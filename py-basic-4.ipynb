    "\n",
    "10. What is difference between the list methods append() and insert()?\n",
    "append adds the object at the end of the list while insert adds the object at the end of list. insert takes the index where new object is to be added.\n",

    "both list values and string values can be acessed through their index.\n",

    "tuples are immutable while lists are mutable\n",

    "15. How do you get a list value's tuple form? How do you get a tuple value's list form?\n",
    "list can be converted to tuple by using  tuple() method and tuple can be converted using list() method\n",
    "\n",
    "16. Variables that \"contain\" list values are not necessarily lists themselves. Instead, what do they contain?\n",
    "\n",
    "17. How do you distinguish between copy.copy() and copy.deepcopy()?\n",
    "copy.copy() is called shallow copy while copy.deepcopy creates a deep copy()\n",
    "when we operate on nested list, the inner list objects refer to same element in both shallow copy and orignal so change in any inner element will bring change in both copy and orignal. however in case of deep copy each element has a seprate memory location and change in orignal dosent affect the copy and vice-versa"
